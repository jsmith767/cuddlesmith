                        "My session with Julian was my first time doing a professional cuddle session. He helped me feel safe throughout this new experience and empowered me to really vocalize my own comfort needs and desires throughout the session. Thanks to that, I was able to enjoy the physical touch with a depth of safety, tenderness and all around comfort which I have seldom been able to find, even with romantic partners."

                        "Julian has a talent for touch! I was a little nervous for my first cuddle session, but Julian was nothing but professional and affirming. In addition to receiving some skillful cuddles, I was also encouraged to explore my own needs throughout the session. I even had a synesthetic experience once I was able to fully let go. I'm so grateful that Julian offers such a thoughtful space for connection - he is the perfect person for it."

                        "The idea of offering a customized physical touch session for feeling connection is just what the world needs. Julian made me feel heard and cared for and allowed me to tap into my inner cues of what I really needed or wanted in that moment. We had a phone call prior going over expectations and talked about boundaries and practiced saying no which I appreciated the attention to detail on creating a comforting environment. His overall professionalism was top-notch, but what makes Julian special is his innate ability to look into your heart, listen to you and provide an unequivocal love human to human. I will definitely be reaching out again and highly recommend everyone to gift themselves with a session with Julian."
