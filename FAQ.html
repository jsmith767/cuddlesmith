                    <div class="answer">
                        Each session is unique and client-directed. We'll start by discussing your boundaries, preferences, and what you're hoping to get from the session. Then we'll engage in consensual, platonic touch such as hugging, hand-holding, gentle back rubs, or simply sitting close together. You're always in control of what happens, and you can change your mind at any time.

                        I've never done something like this before: what is the right way to Cuddle?

                    <div class="answer">
                        That can look entirely different for each session. People are unique and have their own preferences. Some like to talk, some don't. Some like a lot of physical contact, some like a little. Sometimes we feel lively and playful, sometimes we feel quiet and introspective. There are a gazillion right ways to cuddle! As long as you are following the code of conduct and respecting my boundaries, you are doing it right. Half of the fun is in discovering what is right for YOU. I hope you will leave feeling more relaxed, better about yourself and more confident about communicating your own needs while respecting the needs of others. Have fun!

I'd like to see more public displays of cuddling in our world :).

                        Compassionate listening can be a wonderful part of a cuddle session. Cuddling can also be a wonderful place to not have to talk and to enjoy comfortable silence with another. How much you talk and what you talk about is entirely up to the two of us. I am not a counselor or coach, and even if I am in other parts of my life, that is not part of a cuddle session. I will be happy to listen and be honest with you about how much is too much for me in terms of what you share. Everything is confidential unless you share any information of an illegal nature or the intention to do harm.

                        Cuddling takes many forms. Be creative! As long as you are abiding by the code of conduct it is welcomed. Sometimes it looks like massages, playing games, dancing, singing, having a meal, reading aloud to one another, eye gazing, etc.

                        I completed a trauma-informed cuddle therapy course, where I learned The Cuddlist Method, consent and boundaries skills, cultural competency, and relational embodiment techniques. Expert trainers evaluated me for comprehension of the material. I was encouraged to improve my self-awareness and communication skills in ongoing mentorship sessions. I cannot make any promises or guarantees about the quality of your cuddle experience. You are welcome to assess whether I'm a good fit for your individual needs.

                        If you become uncomfortable in any way at any time, please say so. Stop whatever is causing discomfort and adjust accordingly. Please do not wait until your discomfort is large; do this at the first hint of it. Professional cuddling is consent based and I WANT you to speak up. This is the perfect place to practice using your voice. This is your session and none of it needs to feel anything SHORT OF good. If you would like to end your session early for any reason, simply let me know.

                        Arousal is a healthy human response to all kinds of things including touch. It is not a problem in a non-sexual session. The important thing is that neither of us respond to it in a manner intended to increase arousal. It can be acknowledged or not and simply allowed to come and go without taking focus.
